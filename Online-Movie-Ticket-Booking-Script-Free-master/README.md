Before forking this repo I would like to clarify few things

1. This code has been written 3 years back after my b.tech completion. Absolutely perfect working code but I didn’t followed standards so please don’t misunderstand me
2. I still remember those days when I used to go to every theatre  nearer to my hometown. Some added in my site some didn’t. I remember going back home after standing hours near theatre gate. Some years of handwork Im putting and give techies to utilize the code.
3. Before forking If you like just hit a like and star this repo.
